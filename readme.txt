Create your own readable address on the Stellar network by hosting your own Federation Server within WordPress.

== Description ==

### StellarPress Federation: the easy way to host a Stellar Federation server

Addresses in the Stellar network are usually long chains of numbers & characters, not really easy to remember.
With the StellarPress Federation others can use a simple name like "user*yourdomain.com" to send money to you. It implements the standardized Stellar Federation Server protocol so it is supported by almost all wallets for the Stellar network.
Usually you need a server with SSH access to host a Stellar Federation server. But with StellarPress Federation you can run your own Federation server within WordPress, all using minimal overhead and resources!

#### Settings

The StellarPress Federation plugin adds fields to your backend users.
Every backend user with a provided Stellar address will automatically be provided through StellarPress Federation.
